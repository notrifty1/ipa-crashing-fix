If your sideloaded app is crashing after installing or injecting any sort of tweaks simply inject both of these files (FixIPA1 & 2) to prevent this from happening. 
Disclaimer: This is not 100% guarrenteed to work all of the time.

If the first two dont work inject the alternativeIPAfix and it should work. 

Inject alternativeIPAfix byitself.
